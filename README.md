## Building the site locally

To build the site locally, clone this repo and install it in a fresh python 3.11 environment (`pip install -e .`). Then run `make -C docs html O="-T"` and open `docs/build/html/index.html` in your browser.

## strip_text.py

This script creates two copies of each file found at `docs/source/full/*/*md`, the copies are placed at `docs/source/users/*/*.md` and `docs/source/presenters/*/*.md`. Neither of these copies are run; the presenters version is intended as a reference for presenters, while the users version is what users will start with.

For this to work:
- The title should be on a line by itself, use `#` (e.g., `# My awesome title`) and be the first such line (so no comments above it).
- All headers must be markdown-style (using `#`), rather than using `------` underneath them.
- You may need to place blank newlines before/after any `div` opening or closing.

Full notebook:
- Will not render any markdown wrapped in a div with `class='render-user'` or `class='render-presenter'` (but will render those wrapped in `class='render-all'`)
- Will not render or run any code wrapped in a div at all! Thus, for code that you want in all notebooks, add `:tag: [render-all]`, but for code that you only want in the user / presenter notebook, wrap it in a div with `class='render-user'` / `class='render-presenter'`. 
- Similarly, wrapping colon-fence blocks (which use `:::`, e.g., admonitions) are messed up when you wrap them in a `div`. But they have a `:class:` attribute themselves, so just add the appropriate `render` class there. See the "Download" admonition at the top of each notebook for an example.

Presenters version preserves:
- All markdown headers.
- All code blocks.
- Only colon-fence blocks (e.g., admonitions) that have the class `render-presenter` or `render-all`
- Only markdown wrapped in a `<div class='render-presenter'>` or `<div class='render-all'>`.

Users version preserves:
- All markdown headers.
- Only code blocks with `:tag: [render-all]` *OR* wrapped in a `<div class='render-user'>`.
- Only colon-fence blocks (e.g., admonitions) that have the class `render-user` or `render-all`
- Only markdown wrapped in a `<div class='render-user>` or `<div class='render-all'>`.
