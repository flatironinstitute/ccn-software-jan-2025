# CCN Software Workshop, Jan 2025


## Binder

Some usage notes:

- You are only allowed to have a single binder instance running at a time, so if you get the "already have an instance running error", go to the [binderhub page](https://binder.flatironinstitute.org/hub/hub/home) (or click on "check your currently running servers" on the right of the page) to join your running instance.
- If you lose connection halfway through the workshop, go to the [binderhub page](https://binder.flatironinstitute.org/hub/hub/home) to join your running instance rather than restarting the image.
- This is important because if you restart the image, **you will lose all data and progress**.
- The binder will be shutdown automatically after 1 day of inactivity or 7 days of total usage. Data will not persist after the binder instance shuts down, so **please download any notebooks** you want to keep.
- I will destroy this instance in 2 weeks. You can download your notebooks to keep them after the fact.
